## [1.0.0-alpha] - 2025-01-16

### üöÄ BREAKTHROUGH RELEASE: World's First Autonomous AI Development Team

This alpha release introduces the world's first practical multi-agent AI development system capable of autonomous software development from requirements to production.

### ‚ú® Major Features Added

#### üé≠ Multi-Agent Coordination System
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Strategic project coordination with intelligent handoffs
- **Research Agent**: Comprehensive technical analysis and architecture decisions  
- **Implementation Agent**: Production-quality code development with testing
- **Structure Enforcer**: Professional project organization and governance

#### üî¨ Research-Driven Development
- **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**: Documented technical choices with rationale
- **Technical Analysis Reports**: Deep evaluation of frameworks, patterns, and tools
- **Implementation Guides**: Detailed patterns and code examples
- **Research Document Architecture**: Structured knowledge management system

#### ‚ö° Continuous Quality Integration
- **Quality Gates**: Automated testing, linting, and build validation after each feature
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance built into development process
- **TypeScript Integration**: 100% type coverage with strict mode enforcement
- **Performance Optimization**: Bundle analysis and optimization

#### üèóÔ∏è Quality Governance
- **Project Structure Enforcement**: Professional directory organization standards
- **Technical Debt Prevention**: Automated code quality and structure validation
- **Configuration Standards**: Consistent build, test, and lint setup
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatic README and technical documentation

### ü§ñ New Claude Commands

#### Primary Workflow
- `/project:tm-orchestrator-simple` - **MAIN COMMAND**: Complete autonomous development from PRD to production

#### Individual Agents (Advanced Usage)
- `/project:tm-research-agent` - Deep technical research and architecture analysis
- `/project:tm-implementation-agent` - Production code development with quality standards
- `/project:tm-project-structure-enforcer` - Quality project organization governance
- `/project:tm-research-document-architect` - Knowledge management and documentation
- `/project:tm-task-context-templates` - Standardized agent communication patterns

### üìä Proven Results

#### üéØ Multi-Agent Coordination Test: Todo Application
- **Input**: Simple PRD with CRUD requirements
- **Output**: Production Vue 3 application with:
  - Vue 3 + TypeScript + Composition API
  - Tailwind CSS responsive design  
  - Robust local storage with error handling
  - Complete accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - 21 passing unit tests (100% success rate)
  - Professional project structure
  - Bundle optimization (42KB gzipped)

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Performance Metrics
