# Context Summary

## Current Status
- **Project**: Agent Orchestration System with Task Master Integration
- **Phase**: Architecture Review and Root Cause Analysis  
- **Task**: Fixing agent tool access architecture to work properly with Task Master
- **Issue**: Agents creating non-standard task files (`user-management-tasks.json`) outside Task Master workflow

## Completed Work
- ✅ **Orchestration System**: Built and tested all 4 complexity levels
- ✅ **Hybrid Approach**: Workflow-agent for Level 3-4 complexity assessment working
- ✅ **Gate Agents**: 5 specialized validation agents (quality, integration, readiness, completion, task-assignment)
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Validated routing patterns for failed gates
- ✅ **CLAUDE.md**: Updated with orchestration intelligence and routing logic
- ✅ **Testing Complete**: All levels (1-4) tested with proper error recovery workflows

## Root Cause Analysis Results
**Problem**: `tasks/user-management-tasks.json` created outside Task Master standard workflow

**Root Cause**: Orchestration system bypasses Task Master instead of working through it
- Agents have direct task creation capabilities
- No architectural constraints forcing Task Master integration
- PM Agent not acting as Task Master controller

**Correct Architecture Identified**:
- **PM Agent**: Full Task Master MCP access (task management, workflow coordination)
- **Research Agent**: Research + complexity analysis tools (`mcp__task-master__research`, `mcp__task-master__analyze_project_complexity`)
- **Other Agents**: Read-only task access only (`mcp__task-master__get_task`)

## Active Architecture Gap
**Missing Configuration**: Research agent lacks `analyze_project_complexity` tool access
**Current Problem**: Agents can create files outside Task Master framework

## Technical Context
- **Key Files**: 
  - `CLAUDE.md` - Contains orchestration intelligence rules
  - `.claude/agents/*.md` - Agent configurations need tool access updates
  - `tasks/tasks.json` - Should be single source of truth
  - `tasks/user-management-tasks.json` - Non-standard file that shouldn't exist

## Next Steps
1. **Update Agent Configurations**: Fix tool access per architectural requirements
   - PM Agent: Full Task Master MCP access
   - Research Agent: Add complexity analysis tools  
   - Other Agents: Remove task management tools, keep read-only access
2. **Test PM-Centric Workflow**: Validate Task Master integration
3. **Clean Architecture**: Ensure no standalone task files created
4. **Workflow Validation**: Test that orchestration works through Task Master

## Key Decision
**Architectural Principle**: All task operations must go through PM Agent + Task Master MCP. Other agents report back to PM, who updates Task Master state. This prevents fragmented task management and ensures single source of truth.
