# ADR-001: Frontend Framework Selection

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-06-15
**Authors:** Research Agent
**Tags:** architecture, frontend, framework

## Context

The todo application requires a modern JavaScript framework to handle component-based architecture, reactive updates, TypeScript integration, and local storage persistence. The selection will impact development velocity, maintainability, and long-term scalability.

## Decision Drivers

- Bundle size optimization for lightweight application
- Learning curve for team adoption and maintenance
- TypeScript support for type safety
- Ecosystem maturity and community support
- Testing framework integration
- Accessibility implementation ease
- Local storage integration patterns
- Development experience and iteration speed

## Considered Options

### 1. React 18.2.0
- **Pros:** 
  - Smallest core bundle (~6.5KB)
  - Largest ecosystem and community
  - Excellent testing library support
  - Mature TypeScript integration
- **Cons:** 
  - Requires additional libraries for state management
  - JSX learning curve
  - More configuration required
- **Implementation effort:** Medium

### 2. Vue 3.3.0
- **Pros:** 
  - Balanced bundle size (~22.5KB with features)
  - Gentle learning curve with template syntax
  - First-class TypeScript support in Composition API
  - Excellent reactivity system for todo updates
  - VueUse provides elegant local storage integration
- **Cons:** 
  - Smaller ecosystem compared to React
  - Less enterprise adoption
- **Implementation effort:** Low

### 3. Angular 16.0.0
- **Pros:** 
  - Complete framework with built-in solutions
  - Excellent TypeScript support (built with TS)
  - Strong accessibility features
  - Enterprise-grade architecture
- **Cons:** 
  - Large bundle size (~57KB)
  - Steep learning curve
  - Overkill for simple todo application
- **Implementation effort:** High

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Vue 3 with Composition API

**Rationale:** Vue 3 provides the optimal balance of features, simplicity, and development experience for this todo application. The Composition API offers excellent TypeScript support, VueUse simplifies local storage integration, and the template-based approach makes accessibility implementation more intuitive.

## Implementation Guidance

- Use Vue 3.3.0+ with Composition API
- Implement TypeScript throughout the application
- Utilize VueUse for local storage persistence
- Adopt Single File Components (SFCs) for organization
- Use Vite as the build tool for optimal development experience

## Consequences

- **Positive:** 
  - Fast development iteration with Vue's reactivity
  - Clean, maintainable code with SFCs
  - Excellent TypeScript integration
  - Simplified local storage handling
- **Negative:** 
  - Smaller ecosystem than React
  - Team may need Vue-specific training
- **Neutral:** 
  - Framework lock-in acceptable for application scope
  - Migration path available if requirements change

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Bundle size under 50KB for production build
- [ ] TypeScript compilation without errors
- [ ] Local storage integration working seamlessly
- [ ] Accessibility features implemented correctly
- [ ] Unit tests passing with Vue Test Utils
