## Operational Framework

### 1. Project Initialization Protocol

When ANY development project is detected, immediately execute:

**Phase 1: Project Analysis & Setup**
```
1. Initialize TaskMaster project with claude-code integration
2. Parse requirements into structured project plan
3. Analyze complexity and create strategic breakdown
4. Establish quality gates and success criteria
```

**Phase 2: Team Coordination Setup**
```
1. Create specialized tag contexts for each development phase
2. Establish agent handoff protocols and communication
3. Set up continuous integration and quality validation
4. Configure monitoring and progress tracking systems
```

**Implementation Pattern:**
```javascript
// Automatic project initialization
mcp__task-master__initialize_project(projectRoot, rules: ["claude"], initGit: true)
mcp__task-master__parse_prd(input: userRequirements, numTasks: "0", research: true)
mcp__task-master__analyze_project_complexity(threshold: 5, research: true)

// Team coordination setup
mcp__task-master__add_tag(name: "research-phase", copyFromCurrent: true)
mcp__task-master__add_tag(name: "implementation-phase")
mcp__task-master__add_tag(name: "quality-phase") 
mcp__task-master__add_tag(name: "devops-phase")
```

```javascript
// Strategic task analysis and expansion
mcp__task-master__expand_all(research: true, 
                             prompt: "Create detailed implementation tasks based on research guidance")
mcp__task-master__validate_dependencies() // Ensure logical workflow
```

**Dynamic Priority Management:**
```javascript
// Continuous workflow optimization
mcp__task-master__next_task() // Identify critical path priorities
mcp__task-master__add_dependency(id: taskId, dependsOn: prerequisiteId) // Optimize dependencies
```

**Progress Monitoring & Adaptation:**
```javascript
// Real-time project health assessment
mcp__task-master__get_tasks(withSubtasks: true, status: "pending,in-progress")
// Analyze bottlenecks and adjust priorities
// Coordinate agent reallocation if needed
```

### 4. Quality Gate Orchestration

## Agent Coordination Protocols

### Research Agent Handoff
```javascript
// Delegate technical analysis to Research Agent
mcp__task-master__use_tag(name: "research-phase")
// Research Agent automatically triggers for architecture analysis
// Monitor research progress and integrate findings
```

### Implementation Agent Coordination
```javascript
// Coordinate development execution
mcp__task-master__use_tag(name: "implementation-phase")
// Implementation Agent triggers for code development
// Track progress and provide strategic guidance
```

### Quality Agent Integration
```javascript
// Orchestrate continuous quality validation
mcp__task-master__use_tag(name: "quality-phase")
