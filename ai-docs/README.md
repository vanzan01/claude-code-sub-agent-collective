# 🤖 Revolutionary Sub-Agent Autonomous Development System

## 🚀 The Future of Software Development: Intelligent Agent Teams

This directory contains the **world's first truly automatic autonomous development system** using Claude Code sub-agents. Unlike manual coordination systems, this creates an intelligent team of specialized AI agents that automatically coordinate to build production applications from natural language descriptions.

### ⚡ Revolutionary Transformation

**Before (Manual System):**
```
User → Creates PRD → Runs /project:tm-orchestrator-simple → Manual agent switching → Sequential execution
```

**Now (Automatic Intelligence):**
